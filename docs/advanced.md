# Verbosity

To always display the coverage results, use the `--verbose` option:

```sh
$ coverage.space <owner/repo> <metric> --verbose
```

# Exit Codes

To return a non-zero exit code when coverage decreases, use the `--exit-code` option:

```sh
$ coverage.space <owner/repo> <metric> --exit-code
```
